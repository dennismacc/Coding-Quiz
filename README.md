# Coding-Quiz
This application features a timed quiz on WebDevelopment fundamentals that stores high scores so that users can compare their knowledge to their peers.

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow users to take a timed quiz on WebDevelopment fundamentals and compare their scores to other users. The application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript was used to dynamically create the quiz questions and answer choices, as well as create a timer function that counts down the time remaining for the user to answer the quiz and substracts time when the user answers a question incorrectly. Upon finsihing the quiz, the user is presented with a score and may input thier initials to save their score. This score is then saved to local storage and may be viewed later viewing the high scores page that is linked on the application's homepage.

From working on this application I was able to further my skills with JavaScript and work with saving data to local storage. I ran into some issues with the application's functionality (e.g. the timer function was not working properly), but I was able to resolve them by using the JavaScript methods that I had learned in the past.

## Usage
